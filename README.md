# Open-Lab-03.11
(12 XP) A function that checks if a string is a palindrome.

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Open solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Open file `Checker.cs`.
4. Implement the method `IsPalindrome(string str)` that checks if a string is a palindrome.
5. Run with `CTRL+F5` to test it.
6. If all tests are passed, commit & sync your repository.
7. Send a link to your repository for Lab Master (in #slack) to check it.

## Examples: 
```C#
IsPalindrome("oko") ➞ true
IsPalindrome("auto") ➞ false
IsPalindrome("testing") ➞ false
IsPalindrome("abcddcba") ➞ true
```

## Hints:
* A string is a palindrome when it is the same from the front and the back. (original string is equal to its reversed self)
